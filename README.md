This project introduces a next-generation calculator that goes far beyond traditional or AI-based tools which typically rely on text input or static image uploads. Instead, it offers a draw-to-solve interface allowing users to sketch equations, diagrams, or abstract questions directly on a canvas, blending human intuition with AI intelligence.
Powered by Google Gemini Splash AI, the system interprets user-drawn input and supports:
•	Mathematical problem solving via handwritten expressions
•	Abstract and conceptual query handling, such as “What is the meaning of infinity?” or “Which came first, the chicken or the egg?”
•	Real-world scenario modeling, connecting logic, philosophy, and math
