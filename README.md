# 🧠 AI-Powered Visual & Abstract Reasoning Calculator

## 📘 Project Description

This project introduces a next-generation calculator that goes far beyond traditional or AI-based tools, which typically rely on text input or static image uploads. Instead, it offers a **draw-to-solve interface**, allowing users to **sketch equations, diagrams, or abstract questions directly on a canvas**, combining human intuition with AI intelligence.

Powered by **Google Gemini Splash AI**, the system interprets user-drawn input and supports:

- 🧮 **Mathematical problem solving** via handwritten expressions
- 💭 **Abstract and conceptual query handling**, such as _“What is the meaning of infinity?”_ or _“Which came first, the chicken or the egg?”_
- 🌍 **Real-world scenario modeling**, connecting logic, philosophy, and mathematics

> **Key Differentiator**: Unlike most AI tools that rely on typed text or image uploads, this project allows **free-form drawing input**, bridging the gap between visual reasoning and intelligent computation.

Ethical considerations are built-in, including:
- GDPR-compliant data handling
- Bias mitigation
- Inclusive and accessible UI design
