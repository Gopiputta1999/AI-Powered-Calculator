#  AI-Powered Calculator
## Project Description
This project introduces a next-generation calculator that goes far beyond traditional or AI-based tools, which typically rely on text input or static image uploads. Instead, it offers a **draw-to-solve interface**, allowing users to **sketch equations, diagrams, or abstract questions directly on a canvas**, combining human intuition with AI intelligence.

Powered by Google Gemini Splash AI, the system interprets user-drawn input and supports:
- Mathematical problem solving via handwritten expressions
- Abstract and conceptual query handling, such as _“What is the meaning of infinity?”_ or _“Which came first, the chicken or the egg?”_
- Real-world scenario modeling**, connecting logic, philosophy, and mathematics

## Technologies Used

###  Frontend
